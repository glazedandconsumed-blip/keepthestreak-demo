**Math Streak Mechanic**  
_(Canonical Source of Truth – v1)_

---

## 1. Core Identity (LOCKED)

**Working Title:**  
**Math Streak Mechanic**

**Thematic Sentence (North Star):**

> _Math Streak Mechanic is about remembering in a world that taught humans to stop remembering._

**Tone:**  
Quietly funny. Gently bleak. Never nasty, never scary.  
Observational rather than judgmental.

**What the game is NOT:**

- Not about speed
    
- Not about punishment
    
- Not about mastery through grinding
    

---

## 2. Player Fantasy (LOCKED)

- The player is **the Mechanic**
    
- You maintain a failing legacy system
    
- The system does not hate you
    
- Nothing explodes, scolds, or mocks
    
- Things decay when unattended
    

**Failure Philosophy:**  
Failure is expected, quiet, and non-dramatic.  
You are always allowed to return tomorrow.

---

## 3. Core Loop (LOCKED)

- One math equation per day
    
- Today’s equation depends on **yesterday’s answer**
    
- The game **never stores or surfaces yesterday’s answer**
    
- Memory may be:
    
    - internal (remembering)
        
    - external (notes, friends, reminders)
        

**Explicit Rule (Critical):**

> Yesterday’s answer is never revealed to the player as information.

## 4. Lifelines & Bit’s Bypass (LOCKED REFINEMENT)

Certain **earned lifelines** allow Bit to:

- Bypass
    
- Override
    
- Patch around
    

…the dependency on yesterday’s answer.

**Important Distinction:**

- The player is **not given the answer**
    
- The value is **never shown, spoken, logged, or hinted**
    
- The system is temporarily stabilized via intervention
    

**Design Intent:**  
This represents reliance on tools rather than memory.  
Progress continues, but memory debt remains.

**Bit’s Framing (Required):**

- “I bypassed the dependency.”
    
- “This is a workaround, not a fix.”
    
- “Don’t rely on this.”
    

**Constraints (At least 2 must apply):**

- Limited uses
    
- Cannot be used consecutively
    
- Has a cost or side-effect
    
- Leaves visible residue (glitch, instability, reduced reward)

## 5. Internal Villain (LOCKED)

**The Glitch** is not an antagonist to defeat.

It represents:

- Neglect
    
- Cognitive laziness
    
- Over-reliance on systems
    
- Deferred effort
    

**Core Truth:**

> The Glitch does not attack. It waits.

---

## 6. Character: Bit (LOCKED)

**Role:**

- Last fragment of the original OS
    
- Observational, dry, loyal
    
- Breaks the 4th wall gently
    
- Never judges the player
    

**Relationship Arc:**

- Early: explanatory, slightly defensive
    
- Mid: trusting, shorthand, teasing
    
- Late: philosophical, quieter
    

**Opening Line (LOCKED):**

> _“System online. Maintenance required.”_

---

## 7. Presentation Pillars (LOCKED)

### Visual Evolution

- 8-bit → 16-bit → 32-bit
    
- UI complexity and confidence increase
    
- Artifacts evolve from salvage to system
    

### Display Technology Progression

- Monochrome CRT → Color CRT → Pro CRT / Plasma → Early LCD
    
- Pixels remain sharp
    
- Light bleeds; pixels do not blur
    
- Effects reduce as eras advance
    

**Rule:**

> Graphics evolve, displays evolve, emotional stakes evolve.

---

## 8. Store & Public Voice (LOCKED)

**1-Sentence Hook:**

> _Math Streak Mechanic is a daily math ritual where you maintain a failing system by remembering yesterday’s work—miss it, and the machine begins to decay._

**Expanded Description (Dark / Philosophical):**

> Each day, one math equation keeps the system alive—and tomorrow’s depends on what you remember today. Nothing is stored for you. As your streak grows, the machine evolves; when memory slips, it quietly decays, waiting to see if you’ll come back and try again.

**Kicker:**

> _Maintenance is a choice._

---

## 9. Explicit “NO” List (PROTECTION)

- ❌ Never surface yesterday’s answer
    
- ❌ No shaming language
    
- ❌ No loud villains or boss fights
    
- ❌ No infinite retries in a day
    
- ❌ No over-explaining the metaphor
    
- ❌ No feature creep that weakens memory
    

If a feature conflicts with any of the above, it does not ship.
